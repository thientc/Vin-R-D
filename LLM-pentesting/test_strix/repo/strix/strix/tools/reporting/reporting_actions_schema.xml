    <description>Create a vulnerability report for a discovered security issue.

Use this tool to document a specific verified security vulnerability.
Put ALL details in the content field - affected URLs, parameters, proof of concept, remediation steps, CVE references, CVSS scores, technical details, impact assessment, etc.

DO NOT USE:
- For general security observations without specific vulnerabilities
- When you don't have concrete vulnerability details
- When you don't have a proof of concept, or still not 100% sure if it's a vulnerability
- For tracking multiple vulnerabilities (create separate reports)
- For reporting multiple vulnerabilities at once. Use a separate create_vulnerability_report for each vulnerability.
